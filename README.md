### To do list

1. In the E2E test scenario, a user purchase journey happy path was created with the some validation, the purpose is mainly to demo the automation framework extensibility from PoC. We could add more validation on each page, e.g. validate the PO qty / amount /address / notification email received for PO delivery, etc
    
2. Persist user detail data (email address, address, PO number, SKU number, etc) and write into a json file for later validation purpose.
