1. In the E2E test scenario, a user purchase journey happy path was created with the less validation, the purpose is demo the automation framework extensibility. Could add more validation on each page, e.g. validate the qty / amount /address / notification email received for PO delivery, etc
    
2. Persist user data (email address, address, PO number, SKU number, etc) and write into a json file for later validation purpose.
